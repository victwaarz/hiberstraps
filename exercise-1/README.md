## Satellite starter
This is the start point for exercise 1 of the Hibernate course.
It was created using [Spring Initializr](http://start.spring.io).

Included dependencies are Spring Data JPA, Spring Web and the H2 Database driver.

### The exercise

Your goal is to implement the diagram shown below as JPA entity classes.

Starting the Spring application will run an in memory H2 database that you can access through
the [web console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console).
The database schema generated for the entity classes can be viewed there.
